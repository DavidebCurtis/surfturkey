          Greetings! My name is Trey and I am a web developer.
          I am learning the skills to develop amazing web projects! I decided to
          startup my own web development firm while finishing my associates
          degree in web technologies at Forsyth Technical Community College. I
          am a native of Asheboro, NC and<img

          src="assets/img/about/treycourt.jpg"
          alt="A picture of Trey and Courtney"
        /> I am currently residing in Winston
          Salem, NC. I currently work in tech support role in the healthcare
          industry here in Winston. I live with my fiance, Courtney, and we've
          been together since 2019. 
        </p>

              I enjoy a morning pot of coffee and time with my two adopted dogs,
              Bodhi and Woods. I also enjoy games of all sorts. Party games,
              strategy games (my favorite is backgammon), card games, and the
              occasional video game although I definitely don't consider myself a
              'gamer', unlike most tech-heads.<img

            />
            I find pleasure in music of all kinds
            and I love going to see live music events. I mostly listen to many
            sub-genres of rock, reggae-rock (a fusion genre also known as 'good
            vibes'), and metal. I recently have been turned on to lo-fi. It
            provides a deeply satisfying auditory experience if you haven't
            listened to it before; I highly recommend it.

          I found my love for web development all the way back in 1997 and even
          developed a few websites for companies in the time before Y2K. My path
          moved away from tech and into the service industry after high school,
          and it wasn't until 2019 that I really stepped back and realized that
          I didn't particularly enjoy working in that industry anymore. I felt
          it was time for a change. I reflected on what brought me joy since I
          was a young man, and that is the Internet and the complexities of how
          it works. So I took an entry-level job in the tech field and I set out
          to develop web content in my spare time. This move inspired me to
          finish my associate degree in web technologies and I will graduate in
          May 2024. It was during this period of time that I met my good friend
          Adia Chue and inspired her to follow me into the world of web design.
          Together we make up the foundation of SurfTurkey.net, and you can read
          more about her below.

            My exposure to web technologies has been vast thanks to the curriculum
            at FTCC. I have greatly extended my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I'm
            quickly becoming familiar with the JavaScript language - the three
            together are the essential building-blocks of all web content on the
            Internet today. I am also becoming exposed to server-side languages like
            PHP and Python, and database management skills using SQL and MongoDB.
